## _**Hi my name is Devon and this is DeVim.**_

DeVim is my personal dotfiles and tooling setup for full-stack development. It helps me keep a consistent, fast-to-setup environment across both macOS and Windows (via WSL).

Feel free to explore, tweak, or shamelessly steal — most of it was stolen to begin with. Suggestions welcome. ❤️

> [!WARNING]\
> This setup is under **active development**. Things may change frequently, and existing config files might get overwritten.  
> _Make sure to back up anything you want to keep._

## 🛠️ Setup and Learning Resources

> ⚠️ **The bad news:**  
> This repo doesn’t come with an installer, wizard, or training montage.  
> It also won’t teach you how to Vim or tweak Lua. 

<br/>

> ✅ **The good news:**  
> If you know your way around a terminal, setup is chill.  
> I’ve dropped a lil markdown with my keybindings in the docs — should help you get started.
